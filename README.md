# Research of the factors impacting the implementation of Blockchain Technology in the United States

Content overview:

  • The contextualization, research procedure, analysis, results, functional insight gained, and references are detailed in the paper. 

  • An .ipynb file is included as well which details the qualtative analysis and processing of the survey data

  • The image and associated decription depicts how SmartPLS4 software was used to conduct SEM Analysis

A breakdown of the project is as follows:
  
  • Presented with survey response data from questions in alignment with the TOE theoretical framework which has been often used in     
    identifying and categorizing elements which affect BCT adoption
  
  • Cleaned the data and explored the nature of the responses via qualitative data analysis
  
  • Visualized findings from the demographic questions to understand respondent diversity 
  
  • Converted questions pertaining to Blockchain adoption into numerical values via Likert Scaling
  
  • Utilized Smartpls4 software to perform SEM analysis to derive credibility metrics which depicted how well each question pertained to 
    its associated theoretical construct as well as the relationships between constructs themselves and their relevance as potential 
    adoption factors
  
  • Consolidated this procedure into a 17 page report which discusses an overall contextualization, TOE framework, the progression of     
    this project, results, visualizations of findings, and real world implications.
