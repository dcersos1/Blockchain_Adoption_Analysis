BCT_Adoption_Analysis

The contextualization, research procedure, analysis, results, and functional insight gained are detailed in the paper. An .ipynb file is included as well which details the qualtative analysis and processing of the survey data

A breakdown of the project is as follows:
  • Crafted a survey of questions spearheaded by our Professor to evaluate the BCT industry 
  • Developed these survey questions in alignment with the TOE theoretical framework which has been often used in identifying and categorizing elements which affect BCT adoption
  • Distributed to Blockchain experts via our Professor from who we received the data
  • Cleaned the data and explored the nature of the responses via qualitative data analysis
  • Visualized findings from the demographic questions to understand respondent diversity 
  • Converted questions pertaining to Blockchain adoption into numerical values via Likert Scaling
  • Utilized Smartpls4 software to perform SEM analysis to derive credibility metrics which depicted how well each question pertained to its associated theoretical construct as well as the     relationships between constructs themselves and their relevance as potential #adoption factors
  • Consolidated this procedure into a 17 page report which discusses an overall contextualization, the progression of this study, visualizations of findings, and real world implications.
